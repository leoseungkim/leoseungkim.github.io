      <h2>What is the IPA?</h2>

      The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a standardized system of encoding speech sounds as symbols across languages.
      Because orthographic conventions (spellings) can often be imprecise in representing their pronunciations,
      IPA transcriptions can be very useful when we need more precise information about how a word is pronounced,
      whether they be words in English or in previously undocumented languages.
      As an example, the following are some notorious examples in English:

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Spelling</th><th>IPA</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>'cough'</td><td>/kɔf/</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>'dough'</td><td>/dow/</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>'through'</td><td>/θɹu/</td>
        </tr>
      </table>



      <h2>How does this tutorial work?</h2>

      In this tutorial, the emphasis is on practicing. Each concept will be introduced with a short lesson text,
      but students should focus on the practice transcriptions.

      <h2>Why General American English?</h2>

      This tutorial was designed for students of Psycholinguistics (LING3361/PSYC3377) at Boston College to introduce the IPA and to get them comfortable using it.
